# HOLD UP!
Make sure that you are working on your own branch! Publishing your changes directly to the main branch will 200% of the times cause mass chaos, incompatibility issues, and conflicts. Feel free to ask in the Discord on how to make a branch!

**ONLY PUSH TO MAIN** if you are ABSOLUTELY sure that whatever changes you are about to make will not conflict with someone else's! (Things that are least likely to cause conflicts are additions. NOT modifications or deletions. For example, if you just upload an audio, photo, or a new script, that will likely not cause any conflicts. However, if you modify something or delete something, it probably will cause an error!)
Even then, please avoid pushing directly to main. Always make a pull request.

**ALSO** When you make any changes to the main branch (either by a direct push or from a pull request), please make sure to tell everyone about it in the #programming channel! (i.e. what changes you've made)
